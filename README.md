The attached DebugVersion file is the executable.
The attached DICOM_subvol_0_50_0 file is the input 3D image of the porous medium.
The attached result file is the tetrahedral mesh of 3D image of the porous medium generated by the CDT algorithm, the file needs paraview software to be viewed, as the software only supports viewing the surface mesh, if you need to view the volume mesh you can see it in the video in Experiment & Result.
